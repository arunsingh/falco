# Falco APIs

## Summary

With this proposal we inted to present the intent of creating a Falco API.

This proposal also intends to list the set of the gRPC services such API will expose.

## Motivation

We want users to interface with Falco data, rules, and configurations via thirdy-part clients.

Such ability would enable the community to create a whole set of OSS tools, built on Falco.

Some examples, already in place, are:
- [falcoctl](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl)
- [falco-exporter](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-exporter)

## Goals

## Non-Goals

## Proposal

### Use cases

- Receive Falco events with a well-defined contract over wire --> **outputs**
- Receive Falco drops with a well-defined contract over wire --> **drops**
- Receive current Falco version and related meta information (commit hash, built type, etc.) --> **version**
- Config Falco via API (CRUD) -> **configs**
- Inject and/or modify Falco rules via API (CRUD) --> **rules**
- Send input events to Falco over wire --> **inputs**
